Introduction
------------

Annie: Hey, sorry I'm late. I was talking to my roommate about a problem. [id=start]

JJ: What's going on? Is it something you can tell us?

Annie: Oh, yeah, it's not a secret. She's got a babysitting gig for some extra cash,  
but the kid is giving her all kinds of trouble, just like his parents warned her.  
He's six, and he doesn't want to go to bed. He just runs around when it's his bedtime.

Lin: What did the parents say about it?

Annie: They've tried pretty much everything. They've taken away his games and toys, they've tried  
to just let him figure it out on his own, but it's almost like nothing will work for them to  
fix this. She's really frustrated and thinks she should just let him do whatever he wants and  
hope he'll grow out of it. I told her I was meeting with you all and we would try to come up  
with something to help her from what we’ve been learning in our psychology class. 

Lin: Hey! I read in our textbook that a good way to learn something is to actually use it to solve  
a problem. We should be able to use what we're learning from psych to come up with a solution  
for your friend, Annie. We'll also be studying while we’re helping!

Annie: That sounds like a win-win, to me.

Brainstorming [id=scene.2]
--------------------------

JJ: Let's brainstorm some ideas for her. I don't have any kids myself, but I have a younger sister. [id=brainstorming]

Lin: And I've got little cousins.

Annie: Thanks for helping out. She's really stressing about it.  
OK, what do YOU think she should do to get the 6-year-old to go to sleep at bedtime???

--- wait student_suggestion ---

Annie: Haha, we are all over the place with our ideas!

Lin: It looks like the choices are between using behavioral techniques, like we're learning about in class,  
or doing nothing. My suggestion was to do nothing, but now I'm not sure. I'm going to ask the AI  
assistant if there's evidence for that.

# [Results/feedback from group - no activity, just text]
You: Tell him you'll give him 50 cents if he goes to bed on time. Hey, 50 cents is a lot of money to a 6-year-old!

You: Say that you won't play any games with him ever again unless he goes to sleep at his bedtime.

You: I'm with the "do nothing" crowd. She shouldn't do anything at all.  
If he stays up, he stays up. That's on him. He'll be so tired the next day, he'll probably never do it again!

PostQuiz1 -- Understanding Reinforcement and Punishment [id=scene.3] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Lin: I think we're getting a lot closer to helping your roommate out,  
Annie, but can you text her to see what she and the parents have  
been doing recently to try to get the kid to go to bed?

JJ: Good idea. We know it was sometimes "do nothing," but maybe not every time.

Annie: Sure, I’ll text her now and let you know what she says.

Annie: She texted right back. See for yourselves.

Lin: So what is this? Punishment or reinforcement?

JJ: You'd think yelling was punishment! But it doesn't seem to have worked as punishment,  
because his refusing to go to sleep got worse. So in this case, yelling was a reinforcer.  
If yelling worked as a punisher, we would expect that he would stop the problem behaviors  
after being yelled at.

Annie: In other words, their attempt to control his behavior gave him something he wanted, probably attention,  
so every time they tried to bring the problem under control, they were only making it worse.

Lin: That means we need to figure out things to suggest that will reinforce cooperation. We don't want to accidentally reinforce the wrong thing!

PreQuiz2 -- Positive/Negative Reinforcement and Punishment [id=scene.4]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Annie: Hey guys, there's still something we need to get clear in our own heads before we offer any solutions to my roommate.  
The most effective behavior modification technique, according to what we learned earlier, is **positive**  
reinforcement. But I'm not really clear yet on the difference between positive and negative reinforcement.

JJ: I just checked back through my notes ... here's what I have:

JJ: So, positive doesn't mean good, and negative doesn't mean bad. Instead, positive means adding something, and negative  
means taking something away! And it's the same for punishment. Look! Here's what I have in my notes:

Lin: So positive punishment would be like spanking the child every time he tries to avoid bedtime.  
The adult is **adding** spanking, something that is undesirable, to **decrease** the  
child’s behavior of avoiding bedtime.

Annie: And negative punishment would be like taking away his favorite toy whenever he avoids bedtime.  
The adult is **taking away** the toy, something **desirable**, to **decrease** the child’s behavior of avoiding bedtime.

JJ: I'm still not as clear on this as I would like to be. Maybe some practice would help!

Can we take some of the things that the parents have already tried or that we suggested  
early on and figure out what category they fit into? I don't know about you, but that would help me.

Annie: Yeah...me, too. How about if we fill in something like this graphic?

JJ: I found this chart on the Internet. I think it sums things up nicely!

Quiz 1: Reinforcement and Punishment
------------------------------------

JJ: It sounds like we may still be a bit confused on these concepts. I don't think  
we should give Annie's friend any advice until we're sure we know exactly  
what positive reinforcement is!

Lin: You're right!  
Hey, everyone, I've got an idea.  
Do you remember when the TA gave us that practice quiz handout with twenty extra  
questions on it to help us practice telling the difference between reinforcement  
and punishment? Why don’t we try to answer those questions? Then, we can  
discuss them ...

Lin: Here are the first five questions on the quiz.

JJ: Looks like we did pretty well!

JJ: Looks like maybe we should review the answers. We got a fair number wrong.

Lin: Do you guys want to review the answers? Sometimes it helps to review, even if you got most of the answers right.

You: Indicate whether you want to review the correct answers

Lin: Here are the answers to the first five questions.

JJ: I got #3 wrong. I was confused by "accidentally". It didn't matter if it was  
an accident. It reduced the likelihood that Lucas would touch the stove to zero,  
so in terms of psychological theory, it was a punishment.

Lin: Here are the answers to questions six through ten on the quiz.  
Looks like these are all examples of reinforcement!

Annie: #7 confused me. But I guess you can paraphrase it as "Whenever his mom gets upset,  
that makes Matthew more likely to make his bed in the morning," so it's a reinforcer.

JJ: #9 confused me because the sister is probably calling her an artist to be sarcastic.  
She wants her to stop! But the sarcastic praise is still making her more likely to scribble on the walls,  
so it's a reinforcer.

Lin: Here are the answers to questions eleven through fifteen on the quiz.

JJ: #12 confused me because I didn't think NOT doing something would count  
as punishment. But her teacher never calling on her to speak made it less  
likely that Luna would ask questions in class, so it counts as punishment.

Annie: #15 confused me, because dessert was taken away only once. But that one time had a big impact, and took  
the probability that Jackson will try new foods down to zero, so it counts as punishment psychologically.

Lin: #11 confused me, because the dad's actions are making it MORE likely that Michael  
will stay seated. But what's really happening is that the dad is frowning angrily when  
Michael stands up, and that's making Michael less likely to stand. So it's also a punishment.

Lin: Here are the answers to questions sixteen through twenty on the quiz.

Annie: #19 confused me, because the teacher giving Chloe an order didn't  
seem like a punishment to me! But it counts as one, because it made Chloe  
less likely to play with scissors.

JJ: #17 confused me, because it sure sounded like a punishment if she got  
grounded! But grounding her made her study more, so it's a reinforcement,  
the way psychologists think about it. If it increases the likelihood someone  
does something, psychologists call it reinforcement, and if it decreases  
the likelihood, psychologists call it punishment.

# [id=scene.6] Quiz 2: Positive and Negative Reinforcement and Punishment

Lin: Hey everyone -- the TA just told me the quiz we took is a simplified version of the full quiz he gave in past years.

Let's try the full version of the quiz, where we have to decide not only if something is reinforcement or punishment,  
but if it's positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive punishment, or negative punishment.

JJ: I'm game.

Annie: I am, too. Let's give it a try!

Lin: And here are the TA's explanations for questions six through ten.

Lin: Here are the answers to questions eleven through fifteen on the quiz.

Lin: And here are the TA's explanations for questions eleven through fifteen.

Annie: Number 11 confused me because it seemed like something positive was taken away.  
Maybe his father usually smiled and was happy and then when Michael stood,  
that smile was taken away. But then I realized that something was added to  
the situation after he stood which makes it positive. The frown and glare  
are just like the father saying no in a stern voice after an undesirable  
behavior, so it’s adding something undesirable. I was also confused about  
the sitting versus standing parts. Because you can't stand and sit at the  
same time, standing up less meant staying in his seat more, so I thought  
it might be reinforcement of the sitting. However, I realized that what was  
discouraged was the standing. If it decreases the likelihood, psychologists  
call it punishment, and that applies here.

Lin: Here are the answer to the questions sixteen through twenty on the quiz.

Lin: And here are the TA's explanations for the questions sixteen through twenty.

Annie: Number 20 was particularly tricky--in part because the situation referred to a  
punishment in the past. On the other hand, the reference to punishment was a hint.  
We have to assume that Amelia liked participating in group activities in the past.  
Maybe a teacher excluded her in the past following some inappropriate behavior,  
such as being disruptive, and the teacher's intent may have been to decrease that  
inappropriate behavior. Because she had something that she liked taken away by being  
excluded in the past, she learned that she really did not want to participate in the  
group after all. Essentially, she was discouraged from participating by having  
participation taken away.

# [id=scene.7] Considering No-Rules Parenting

Lin: Good job, Annie! That's a lot of content. I guess we had better each go over it before we discuss it.

JJ: This research is amazing!

Annie: It is a lot. I actually had to ask the question several different ways to get  
all of the information I found. Sometimes small differences in the way I asked  
the question got me a very different answer.

JJ: So much for "do nothing" lol. It seems like there's a lot more evidence against no-rules parenting than for it.

Lin: I agree with JJ. Annie, since your friend is about ready to give up,  
maybe we should put together an email that explains why giving up  
and going with no-rules parenting (and no bedtime) would be a bad idea.

Annie: All right. Once we write that, we can look into what we have learned about  
effective methods to set a consistent bedtime, and add that to our email.

Annie: To make sure that our email is really good, let's get some feedback from AI.  
If we need to improve our email, we can go back and change the text, then get more feedback.

Lin: Here's the prompt I wrote for us to try to get feedback from AI. It took a bit of  
work to make it precise enough to give us targeted feedback:

Lin: *Here is an email I wrote to explain to a friend why they need to avoid a no-rules  
parenting approach and find a good strategy to get a six-year-old child to bed on time.*

*Briefly, in no more than two or three sentences, evaluate how well I have used evidence from psychology  
to support this argument (but restricting that feedback to feedback that is appropriate given  
the purpose of the email).*

# [id=scene.8] Selecting a Strategy

Annie: All right, I think we've covered no-rules parenting. But our email really needs  
to give my friend a practical solution -- one we know will work, because there's good  
psychological evidence for it. So I also dug into information about strategies we  
could suggest to her, so she can solve that bedtime problem!

There’s only one issue. I have seven different ideas for how to address sleep  
refusal. Which is a lot!

Lin: Well, I know which one I like! Why don't we take a poll and see which of these choices  
we think we should recommend?

Annie: Well ... since it seems like we can’t agree on what to recommend, maybe we should  
take a closer look at the notes I put together about each strategy.

JJ: Hey Annie, do you know if your friend's child gets scared or anxious when bedtime approaches?  
I hadn't even thought about the need for empathy and emotional support.

Annie: I don't know. I'll have to ask her.

JJ: Woah! There’s honestly a lot of good strategies she could try,  
and we haven’t even covered them all yet.

Lin: Wow, Annie. There's so much information here,  
I'm not sure how to explain it to your friend  
or what she could even do with it.

Annie: Yeah. I think we're going to have to figure out  
which of these is the **best** thing for her to try and explain that!

Lin: OK, so now that we know what the strategies are, we can figure  
out which of them is the best choice for your roommate to use,  
Annie. But how should we go about doing that?

JJ: Well, not all of the strategies will apply to a six-year-old. We should  
eliminate any that seem unlikely to to work with younger children.

Annie: Also, some of the strategies might work better for the parents, because  
they're around all the time. We need a strategy Annie's friend can use  
even if it doesn't line up with what the parents are doing.

Lin: There's another thing to think about. Annie's friend needs fast results!  
We shouldn't advise her to try anything that would take a long time,  
or only make small changes to the child's behavior.

Annie: That makes sense! So let's take it step by step, and see which  
of the strategies we can eliminate using one of these criteria.

Annie: Let's start by checking whether any of these strategies aren't likely to work on younger children.  
Even if we only eliminate one of the seven, it'll be a start.

# [activity: AI feedback on age appropriacy]
peg_sba_sidebar -> age_appropriacy_feedback

Lin: So the next thing we agreed to check on was which of these strategies makes sense for the babysitter to try.  
It has to be something she can **change** while she is babysitting, not something that requires changes to  
the child's or the family's usual habits and practices when the babysitter isn't there.

Annie: OK, I've put together this table to show what we decided:  
Incidentally, some of us got a response from the AI that said collaborative problem  
solving wasn't completely feasible, because it requires intimate knowledge,  
trust, and an ongoing relationship. But I think my friend has that kind of  
relationship, so I've marked "collaborative problem solving" as feasible.

JJ: That means we've narrowed down our choices to three:

- Positive Reinforcement  
- Empathy and Emotional Support  
- Collaborative Problem Solving

Lin: Well, I guess we need to figure out which of these techniques works best. I remember from my psychology course  
that these strategies are called "parenting techniques", and if you want to know how effective they are, you  
look into their "effect size".

Annie: Let's take a break then, and each of us do some research. Let's see what we can come up with!

JJ: I asked ChatGPT: "What are the short-term effect sizes for the following parenting techniques:  
positive reinforcement, empathy and emotional support, and collaborative problem solving?"

When I ran it a few times, it consistently said **positive reinforcement** has **moderate to large**  
effect sizes, **empathy and emotional support** have **moderate** effect sizes, and **collaborative  
problem solving** has **small to moderate** effect sizes.

If we're going with this, we should probably recommend that Annie's friend try positive  
reinforcement to solve the kid's bedtime problem.

Lin: Well, when I tried to get sources from the AI, they weren't helpful. So I went to Google Scholar  
instead because that's a great place to look for research articles. At first a lot of the results  
were irrelevant, but I finally had some luck when I typed in the following search:

*What are the effect sizes for parenting techniques?*

Look at the article that was at the top of the search!
What to teach parents to reduce disruptive child behavior: two meta-analyses of parenting program components (https://www.jaacap.org/action/showPdf?pii=S0890-8567%2818%2931980-4)
It actually looks at both long-term and short-term effects. When I dug into the details, I found a table that showed  
a larger absolute effect size for positive reinforcement reducing problem behaviors than for empathy and problem-solving!

Annie: I thought I would go old-school and simply use the subject index at the back of the textbook!

At first, the results were frustrating. The entries for "positive reinforcement" didn't say anything about how effective it was,  
compared to anything else. Looking up emotion and empathy didn't lead me to anything useful, and I couldn't even find  
"collaborative problem solving" in the index.

But then I looked for "parenting techniques". I found a section labeled, "Parent-child relationship", and  
under that there was an entry, "operant conditioning, and". The comma, and part really means, "operant  
conditioning and the parent-child relationship". I remembered from when we were studying operant conditioning  
that it works through positive (and also negative reinforcement), so I figured it was a good place to look,  
especially since I couldn't find anything else that was relevant. Here's what the textbook says, on page 243:

*As we have seen, parents can learn from operant conditioning practices ... parents should remember the basic  
rule of shaping: **Notice people doing something right and affirm them for it.** Give children attention and  
other reinforcers when they are behaving **well** .... Target a specific behavior, reward it, and watch  
it increase. When children misbehave, don't yell at them or hit them. Simply explain the misbehavior  
and take away the screen time, remove a misused toy, or give a brief time-out.*

Since operant conditioning (and hence positive and negative reinforcement) is pretty much the only advice the book gives about  
childhood misbehavior, I think that confirms it. **Positive reinforcement** is what we should recommend!
