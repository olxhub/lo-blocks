                         Rarely or Never (corresponding to 4)

                   Our row headers are: 
                         Fiction (including drama and fan fiction and graphic novels),

                   never writes fiction for school,
                   writes lists for school on a weekly or daily basis, 
                   may write essays for school only once a semester,
                   writes text messages for school every day,

              the student's responses. The version we had didn't seem to really spark
              student interest and we need to redo it.
              
              After the AI summary, students were given the following CR prompt:
              
              _Reread the computer's list of statements about your writing based on your
              responses. Choose on that you agree with and provide an example from your
              writing experience to explain why you agree._
              
              On the next screen after that, students got the following CR prompt:
              
              _Now choose one item from the list that surprises you or that you disagree with
              and provide an explanation from your writing experiences to explain why the
              statement surprises you or why you disagree with it._
              
              The next two screens provide some useful information we can use to discuss
              next design steps to get this basic structure back up and running in the new system.
