## About This Scenario

Your class teammates are JJ, Lin, and Annie. Your team is responsible for helping each other identify key concepts, review and learn from readings, and organize information to develop a solution to the problem.

Lianne Park is a graduate student and member of your team. She will provide guidance as necessary to help you with key information.

In this module, you will review and apply several concepts from your coursework on behavior modification. Specifically, you will:

 - **Review fidelity of implementation for a psychology intervention**
 - **Brainstorm revisions to the intervention plan developed in earlier modules**
 - **Use an AI Assistant to support learning and problem solving**

  <Markdown id="fidelity_intro">
## Implementation Fidelity

**Implementation fidelity** refers to how accurately and consistently a behavior plan is implemented as it was designed.

### Key Aspects of Fidelity:

| Aspect | Question |
|--------|----------|
| **Adherence** | Are all steps of the plan followed as written? |
| **Dosage** | Is the plan used for the correct amount of time/frequency? |
| **Quality of Delivery** | Are strategies implemented correctly with intended tone/approach? |
| **Participant Responsiveness** | Is the child actually exposed to and engaged with the intervention? |
| **Program Differentiation** | Are other strategies (not part of the plan) avoided during implementation? |

We need advice on a psychological intervention using operant conditioning.
          
Annie's roommate is babysitting a six-year-old boy, and has been having
trouble getting him to go to bed. He keeps running away, laughing, or doing
other things that delay bedtime. We tried to put together an intervention
plan that uses positive reinforcement, but it didn't quite work, so we put
together a more complicated plan that changes the antecedent conditions as
well as the consequent conditions. Here's our description of that plan:
      </Markdown>
      <Use ref="intervention_email" />
      <Markdown>
Here is what happened when Annie's roommate tried to implement the plan:
          
The boy went to bed on time the first couple of times, but then bedtime
got later and later. The six-year-old's escape behaviors actually got worse.
          
When we checked on what Annie's roommate was actually doing, we learned
that she was having trouble adhering to the plan. Specifically, we found out
that sometimes she forgets to do the warning countdown and timer, she often 
forgets the small bedtime reward, and often falls into negotiating or arguing
when he whines for extended time.

Given the problems that Annie's roommate is having getting the boy to bed
on time, what advice should we give her to help her improve her adherence
to the intervention plan?

## Provide Just A Little More Support for Amy's Roommate

Based on what you have learned, produce an email in which you tell
Amy's roommate about **one more way** she can improve her fidelity of 
implementation, besides using the two checklists.

You can use one of the suggestions provided by the AI, but if you do,
be sure to tweak it and provide extra details to make it as useful as
possible.

BACKGROUND:
Here is a student's email suggesting how her friend's roommate who is babysitting
a six-year-old with sleep refusal issues should change her intervention plan designed
to get the child to bed on time regularly, in order to improve adherence:

        <ref target="revision_email" />

The following suggested checklists the babysitter could follow were provided
by other students:

        <ref target="fidelity_checklist" />
        <ref target="fidelity_checklist2" />

The following is a list of AI suggestions about how the babysitter could improve her
adherence to the intervention plan to overcome the six-year-old's sleep refusal issue:

        <ref target="modifications_ai_response2" />

DIRECTIONS:
First, check whether the student's revision email overlaps in content with the checklists
provided by other students. If there is such an overlap, say so briefly, in a sentence or so.

Next, check whether the student's revision email overlaps in content with the list of AI suggestions about how the babysitter could improve her adherence to the intervention plan. If there is any overlap, identify it and point out what parts of the response are original --
that is, present neither in the information provided by other students nor in the AI response.

Finally, evaluate the advice provided in the student email for consistency with what is
known about using operant conditioning to treat sleep refusal and with what is known about effective ways to improve adherence to an intervention, focusing on whether the proposed plan is sound and effective.

1. Whether the behavior was successfully or unsuccessfully modified
2. What aspects of the intervention were effective **and** not effective

4. Your personal reflections about the execution of this project, including what could have been done differentlyThe modified intervention was a success! With better adherence to the plan, Johnny's bedtime behavior improved significantly

## Module Complete!

### What You've Learned:

1. **Function of Behavior** - The four main functions (attention, escape, access, sensory) and how to identify them
2. **ABCs** - How to analyze Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence sequences
3. **Competing Behavior Pathway** - How to plan interventions by mapping problem behaviors to desired behaviors
4. **Intervention Planning** - How to select strategies that match the function of behavior
5. **Implementation Fidelity** - Why consistent implementation matters and how to improve adherence

### Your Journey:

You successfully helped Annie's roommate solve Johnny's bedtime problem by:
- Identifying the function of his running-away behavior (escape)
- Creating a competing behavior pathway
- Selecting appropriate antecedent and consequence strategies
- Recognizing and addressing implementation fidelity issues

**Great work using behavioral psychology to solve a real problem!**
