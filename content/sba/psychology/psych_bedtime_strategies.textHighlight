Parents have tried various approaches to get their 6-year-old to go to bed:

1. [Offering a special bedtime story if the child gets ready for bed on time]
2. Taking away toys when the child refuses to go to bed
3. [Creating a sticker chart where the child earns stars for each successful bedtime]
4. Yelling at the child when they run around at bedtime
5. [Allowing extra playtime the next day when bedtime goes smoothly]
6. Sending the child to their room alone as punishment
7. [Praising the child enthusiastically when they cooperate with bedtime routine]
8. Threatening to cancel weekend activities if bedtime problems continue
9. [Setting up a reward system where 5 good bedtimes earn a small toy]
10. Ignoring the child completely when they refuse to go to bed
