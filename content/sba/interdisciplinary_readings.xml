## Abstract

This study examines whether ADHD increases the likelihood of grade retention and high school dropout, even when accounting for IQ, learning disorders, and social class. The study involved 404 individuals with ADHD and 349 controls. Results showed that 28% of those with ADHD repeated a grade compared to 7% of controls. Social class and IQ were significant predictors of dropout or grade retention, with females with ADHD at higher risk than males. Early identification and intervention for ADHD are crucial to prevent these negative educational outcomes.

## Introduction

Each year, many students in the U.S. fail to graduate high school on time, leading to negative life outcomes. Grade retention is also a significant predictor of high school dropout. Identifying psychological risk factors, such as ADHD, is important for intervention efforts.

## Background

ADHD is consistently linked to educational deficits, including school failure, poor grades, and grade retention. Previous studies have shown that ADHD increases the risk of dropping out of high school.

## Method

The study used data from three large case-control studies at Massachusetts General Hospital. Participants included boys and girls with and without ADHD, as well as adults. Psychiatric interviews, socioeconomic status measures, and IQ tests were conducted.

## Results

Participants with ADHD were significantly more likely to repeat a grade or drop out of high school compared to controls. Females with ADHD had a higher risk of grade retention/dropout than males. Social class and IQ were also significant predictors.

## Discussion

ADHD is a significant risk factor for grade retention and high school dropout, independent of other factors like IQ and social class. Early identification and intervention are critical to mitigate these risks. The study highlights the importance of addressing ADHD to improve educational outcomes.

## Conclusion

ADHD significantly contributes to grade retention and high school dropout. Early screening and intervention can help prevent these negative outcomes, benefiting individuals, families, and society.

# Is Adolescent Employment Still a Risk Factor for High School Dropout?

## Metadata

**Authors:** Jeremy Staff, Alyssa M. Yetter, Kelsey Cundiff, Nayan Ramirez, Mike Vuolo, Jeylan T. Mortimer

**Journal:** Journal of Research on Adolescence

**Publication Year:** 2019

**Volume:** 30

**Issue:** 2

**Pages:** 406-422

## Abstract

This study examines whether working long hours during high school is still a risk factor for dropping out. Using data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, the authors found that intensive work (more than 20 hours per week) is still linked to higher dropout rates and lower grades. Despite fewer teens working long hours today, disadvantaged youth are still overrepresented among those who work intensively and drop out.

## Introduction

Understanding why students choose to drop out is critical for finding ways to support students' decision to stay in school. There has been some speculation that students feel economic pressures that lead them to decide to drop out of school. In fact, past research has shown that working long hours during high school increases the risk of dropping out. This study revisits this issue using recent data, considering changes in the labor market and educational landscape.

## Method

The study uses data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, which surveyed ninth graders in 2009 and followed them through high school. The sample includes 25,210 students, with data on their employment, academic performance, and family background.

## Results

### Employment Trends

Only 11% of students worked more than 20 hours per week during the school year.

### Dropout Rates

Intensive workers had a 44% higher chance of dropping out compared to non-workers, even after controlling for other factors.

### Grades

Intensive workers had significantly lower GPAs compared to non-workers and moderate workers.

## Discussion

Intensive work during high school remains a risk factor for poor academic outcomes and dropout. The study suggests that schools should provide more support and flexibility for students who need to work long hours.

## Conclusion

Despite changes in the labor market, working long hours during high school is still associated with higher dropout rates and lower academic performance. Policies should address the needs of working students to help them stay in school and succeed academically.

# Rural and Urban High School Dropout Rates: Are They Different?

## Metadata

**Authors:** Jeffrey L. Jordan, Genti Kostandini, Elton Mykerezi

**Journal:** Journal of Research in Rural Education

**Publication Year:** 2012

**Volume:** 27

**Issue:** 12

**Pages:** 1-21

## Abstract

This study compares dropout rates in rural versus urban areas using longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) from both 1979 and 1997. The analysis finds similar graduation rates across rural and urban settings, with family characteristics serving as the main determinants of educational outcomes rather than geographic location. The findings suggest that interventions should focus on family support and student engagement regardless of setting.

## Introduction

Conventional wisdom often suggests that rural students face different educational challenges than their urban counterparts, potentially leading to different dropout patterns. This study examines whether geographic setting independently affects high school completion rates.

## Method

The study uses data from two cohorts of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79 and NLSY97), providing a comprehensive look at dropout patterns across different time periods and geographic settings. The analysis controls for family background, socioeconomic status, and individual characteristics.

## Results

The data reveal no significant difference in high school completion rates between rural and urban students when controlling for family characteristics. Key predictors of dropout include:

- Family socioeconomic status
- Parental education levels
- Student academic preparation
- Peer influences and social networks

Geographic location per se does not appear to be a determining factor.

## Discussion

The findings challenge common assumptions about rural-urban differences in educational outcomes. Both settings face similar challenges in keeping students engaged and supporting them through graduation. The study suggests that policies targeting family support and student engagement will be effective regardless of geographic context.

## Conclusion

Rural and urban high school dropout rates are similar when accounting for family and individual characteristics. Educational interventions should focus on addressing family support needs and student engagement rather than assuming geographic location determines outcomes.

# Marijuana Use and High School Dropout: The Influence of Unobservables

## Metadata

**Pages:** 1281-1299

## Abstract

This study uses propensity score methods to examine the relationship between marijuana use and high school dropout. The analysis finds that the association between marijuana use and dropout is largely explained by pre-existing differences in student characteristics and peer influences rather than cognitive effects of marijuana use itself. This suggests that interventions should address underlying risk factors rather than focusing solely on substance use.

## Introduction

Marijuana use among adolescents has long been associated with negative educational outcomes, including high school dropout. However, establishing causality is challenging because students who use marijuana may differ in important ways from those who do not. This study uses advanced statistical methods to better understand this relationship.

## Method

The study employs propensity score matching and stratification methods using longitudinal survey data. This approach helps control for selection bias by comparing marijuana users to non-users with similar observable characteristics and risk profiles.

## Results

When controlling for pre-existing differences between users and non-users, the apparent effect of marijuana use on dropout diminishes substantially. Key findings include:

- Much of the association is explained by prior academic performance
- Peer influences and social networks play a significant role
- Family background and socioeconomic factors are important predictors
- Direct cognitive effects of marijuana use appear less influential than previously thought

## Discussion

The findings suggest that marijuana use may be a marker for other risk factors rather than a direct cause of dropout. Students who use marijuana often face multiple challenges including poor academic preparation, unsupportive home environments, and association with peers who are disengaged from school. Effective interventions should address these underlying issues.

## Conclusion

The relationship between marijuana use and high school dropout is complex and largely mediated by pre-existing differences and peer influences. Prevention efforts should focus on comprehensive support for at-risk students rather than single-issue approaches focused solely on substance use.
