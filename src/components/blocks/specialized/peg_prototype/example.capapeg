Newton's Laws
===

Consider a ball thrown straight up into the air.

>>At the highest point of its trajectory, what is the net force on the ball?<<

( ) Zero - the ball is momentarily at rest
(x) Downward - gravity acts continuously
( ) Upward - residual force from the throw
( ) Undefined - forces cancel out

||Think about what force is always acting on objects near Earth's surface.||
