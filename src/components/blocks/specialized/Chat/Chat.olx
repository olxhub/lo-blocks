Alex: Hey! Ready to review for the exam?

Sam: Definitely. I'm still confused about photosynthesis.

Alex: Let's break it down. Plants take in carbon dioxide and water...

Sam: And use sunlight to make glucose, right?

Alex: Exactly! The light energy converts CO2 and H2O into sugar and oxygen.

Sam: So the oxygen we breathe is basically a byproduct?

Alex: You got it! That's why plants are so important for our atmosphere.
