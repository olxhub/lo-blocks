Introduction [id=intro]
-----------------------

Professor Liu: Today we're discussing how instructional methods that help beginners can actually hinder experts.

Amara: Is this about cognitive load theory?

Professor Liu: Yes, specifically the expertise reversal effect discovered by Kalyuga and colleagues.

# Transition to worked examples

The Evidence [id=evidence]
--------------------------

Jordan: Can you give an example?

Professor Liu: Consider worked examples. For novices, step-by-step solutions reduce extraneous cognitive load. But experts already have schemas that make those steps redundant. [face=smile]

Amara: So the extra information becomes noise for experts? [face=awe]

Professor Liu: Exactly. The same instructional support that helps a novice can split an expert's attention between their own knowledge and the redundant guidance.

Implications [id=implications]
-------------------------------

Jordan: What does this mean for instructional design?

Professor Liu: It's one of the strongest arguments for adaptive systems that adjust to the learner's level. Fade scaffolding as expertise develops.

Amara: Like gradually removing worked steps until students solve problems independently?

Professor Liu: Precisely. Renkl's fading strategy does exactly that — and it works across domains from math to biology.
