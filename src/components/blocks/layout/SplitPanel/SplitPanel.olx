# How to Design a Study Schedule

Follow these steps to space out your studying:

**Step 1:** Decide when your test or assessment is

**Step 2:** Count backward from that date

**Step 3:** Plan study sessions at intervals of 10-20% of total time until the test

For example, if your test is in 30 days:
- Schedule sessions about 3-6 days apart
- This spacing helps your brain retain information longer
