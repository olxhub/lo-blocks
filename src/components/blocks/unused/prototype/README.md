Prototype Blocks
================

These are liable to break at any moment. We want an opportunity to:

- Have an LLM generate large numbers of blocks with specific APIs
- Do so ourselves, or with the help of others

There was a friction between this kind of rapid prototyping /
development, and having a sustainable codebase, so this is a place to
throw things which might break, fail, etc.

Once something looks decent, it can graduate out of here. And if
something in here breaks, that's okay too.

This is also helpful for testing the core system, keeping in mind that
a failure in a test here doesn't necessarily indicate a failure in the
core system.
