Assessment Design
===

You're designing a formative assessment for a middle school science class studying ecosystems.

>>Select all characteristics of effective formative assessment:<<

[x] Provides immediate feedback to students
[ ] Counts heavily toward the final grade
[x] Identifies misconceptions early
[x] Informs instructional adjustments
[ ] Used for high-stakes decisions like promotion
[x] Occurs during the learning process

||Think about the purpose of formative vs. summative assessment.||

[explanation]
Formative assessment is designed to monitor student learning and provide ongoing feedback. It should:
- Provide immediate feedback so students can adjust
- Identify misconceptions before they become entrenched
- Help teachers adjust instruction
- Occur during learning, not just at the end

High-stakes grading and promotion decisions are characteristics of summative assessment.
