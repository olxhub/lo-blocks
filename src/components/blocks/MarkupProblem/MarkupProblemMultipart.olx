Multipart Problems
===

This demonstrates a multipart problem with multiple question types. While MarkupProblem supports this, multipart problems can confuse students: if they get one part wrong, it's hard to identify which part or find the correct answer. Consider using separate single-question problems instead.

>>Who developed the theory of the "zone of proximal development"?<<

( ) Piaget
( ) Skinner
(x) Vygotsky
( ) Bandura

||This psychologist emphasized the social nature of learning.||

====
This researcher worked in the Soviet Union in the early 20th century.
}}

[explanation]
Lev Vygotsky developed the zone of proximal development (ZPD), which describes the space between what a learner can do independently and what they can achieve with guidance. This was a measurement methodology. A common misconception is that kids ought to be taught within the ZPD (which consistently leads to kids not being sufficiently challenged).
